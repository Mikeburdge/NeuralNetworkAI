# Neural Network Visualization and Editing

This project aims to provide a user-friendly interface to visualize and edit neural networks using ImGui, Vulkan, and GLFW3. The primary goal is to facilitate the understanding of neural network architectures and enable easy manipulation of weights and biases.

## Features

- **Neural Network Visualization:** Display neural network layers and neurons in a column-row layout.
- **Editable Weights and Biases:** Allow users to modify weights and biases through an intuitive interface.
- **Dynamic Layer Handling:** Accommodate neural networks of varying layer sizes and complexities.

## How to Use

1. **Setting up the Environment:**
    - Ensure you have Vulkan and GLFW3 installed.
    - Install ImGui library.
    - Clone this repository.

2. **Running the Program:**
    - Build the project using your preferred build system.
    - Run the executable to launch the visualization and editing window.

3. **Using the Interface:**
    - Click on the respective buttons to view the neural network visualization or to edit weights and biases.
    - In the visualization window, each layer is represented in columns with neurons displayed in rows. Weights and biases can be edited in the edit window.
